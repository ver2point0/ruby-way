# Ruby's case statement has some unique features compared to other languages

# consider the following trivial case statement
# case expression
#   when value
#     some_action
# end

# the expression is compared with value, some_action is performed if they correspond

# the === (relationship operator) does not always denote equality
# if value === expression
#   some_action
# end
# this if statement is equivalent to the above case statement

# do not confuse relationship operator with equality operator (==).
